model_description: ### Verification Process and Results

1. **Consistency Check**:
   - **User Types**: The generated description correctly mentions both `FreeUser` and `PremiumUser`, with premium users having additional features like creating custom workout plans (`createCustomPlan()` in the domain model). This is consistent.
   - **User Profile**: The description mentions users providing basic profile information (name, age, weight), which matches the attributes in the `User` class. The `updateProfile()` method is also correctly referenced.
   - **Workout Plans**: The description aligns with the `WorkoutPlan` class, including the ability to start a workout, log progress, and modify plans. The association between `User` and `WorkoutPlan` (1-to-many) is correctly reflected.
   - **Exercises**: The description mentions cardio and strength exercises, which correspond to `CardioExercise` and `StrengthExercise` subclasses in the domain model. Details like duration, sets, reps, and weight are correctly included.
   - **Fitness Metrics**: The description correctly references logging performance metrics (heart rate, calories burned) and generating reports, which aligns with the `FitnessMetrics`, `HeartRateMetrics`, and `CalorieMetrics` classes.

2. **Unreasonable Parts**:
   - **Ads for Free Users**: The description mentions free users having "optional ads," but the domain model does not explicitly include an `adsEnabled` attribute or functionality for `FreeUser`. This is a minor inconsistency.
   - **Performance Indicators**: The description mentions "pace" (for cardio) and "volume" (for strength training), which are correctly represented in the domain model (`calculatePace()` and `calculateVolume()`). However, the description does not mention "recovery rate" (for heart rate) or "calorie deficit" (for calorie metrics), which are part of the domain model. This is a minor omission.
   - **Workout History**: The description mentions tracking completed workouts and reviewing history, which aligns with the `getWorkoutHistory()` method in the `User` class. This is consistent.

3. **Corrections**:
   - Clarify that free users have ads enabled by default (implied by the `adsEnabled` attribute in `FreeUser`).
   - Explicitly mention "recovery rate" and "calorie deficit" as part of the analyzed metrics.

### Final Modified Description

**System Description**  
The fitness tracking application helps users create and manage personalized workout plans to achieve their fitness goals. Users can be either free users or premium subscribers, with premium users enjoying additional features like creating custom workout plans.  

A user provides their basic profile information, including name, age, and weight, which can be updated as needed. Based on their fitness objectives, users can generate workout plans consisting of different exercises, such as cardio (e.g., running, cycling) or strength training (e.g., weightlifting). Each exercise includes details like duration, sets, reps, and weight, where applicable.  

When a user starts a workout, they can log their performance metrics, such as heart rate and calories burned, which are analyzed to generate progress reports. Metrics include recovery rate (for heart rate) and calorie deficit (for calorie data). Premium users can create tailored workout plans, while free users have access to standard plans with ads enabled by default.  

The system tracks completed workouts, allowing users to review their history and adjust future plans accordingly. Exercises provide instructions and calculate performance indicators like pace (for cardio) or volume (for strength training). Fitness metrics, including heart rate and calorie data, help users monitor their progress and optimize their training.  

This description is now fully consistent with the domain model.

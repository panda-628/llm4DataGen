model_description: ### Verification Process and Results

1. **Consistency Check with Domain Model**:
   - **Patient Class**: The description mentions patients can "retrieve their medical records," but the domain model specifies `getMedicalHistory(): String`. These are slightly different (records vs. history), but conceptually similar. No correction needed.
   - **Doctor Class**: The description correctly mentions doctors can "update their availability" (`updateAvailability(): void` in the model) and are associated with a specialization (`specialization: String`). No issues.
   - **Appointment Class**: The description includes "scheduled time" (`appointmentTime: DateTime`), "status" (`status: AppointmentStatus`), and "confirmed" (`isConfirmed(): boolean`). It also mentions rescheduling, which aligns with `reschedule(newTime: DateTime): boolean`. No issues.
   - **MedicalRecord and Prescription**: The description correctly states that a confirmed appointment is linked to a medical record (`Appointment "1" -- "1" MedicalRecord`) and may have an optional prescription (`Appointment "1" -- "0..1" Prescription`). No issues.
   - **Person and Schedulable**: The description does not explicitly mention the `Person` abstract class or the `Schedulable` interface, but their attributes (e.g., `name`, `contactInfo`) and behaviors (e.g., `scheduleAppointment()`) are implicitly covered in the description of `Patient` and `Doctor`. No correction needed.

2. **Unreasonable Parts**:
   - The description mentions patients can "access their medical history," but the domain model specifies `getMedicalHistory(): String` (a method, not a direct attribute). This is a minor inconsistency but does not affect functionality.
   - The description states "Each patient provides their name, age, and contact information," but the domain model shows `contactInfo` as part of the `Person` class (inherited by `Patient`). This is technically correct but could be clarified.
   - The description does not mention the `isArchived` attribute of `MedicalRecord`, but this is a minor omission.

### Corrections and Final Modified Description
Here is the corrected description with minor clarifications:

---

### **System Description**  
The healthcare appointment scheduling system facilitates the management of medical appointments between patients and doctors. Patients can schedule, cancel, or reschedule appointments and retrieve their medical history. Doctors can update their availability and view their scheduled appointments.  

Each patient provides their name, age, and contact information (inherited from the `Person` class). Patients can request appointments, cancel existing ones, or retrieve their medical history via the `getMedicalHistory()` method. Doctors are associated with a specialization and can adjust their availability using the `updateAvailability()` method.  

Appointments include details such as the scheduled time (`appointmentTime`) and status (e.g., confirmed, pending). A confirmed appointment is linked to a medical record containing diagnosis and treatment details (with an `isArchived` flag), as well as an optional prescription specifying medication, dosage, and duration.  

The system ensures seamless coordination between patients and doctors, improving efficiency in healthcare service delivery.

### Summary of Changes:
1. Clarified that `contactInfo` is inherited from `Person`.
2. Replaced "access their medical history" with "retrieve their medical history via `getMedicalHistory()`" for consistency with the domain model.
3. Added mention of `isArchived` for `MedicalRecord`.
4. Minor phrasing improvements for precision.

The corrected description now fully aligns with the domain model and removes any ambiguities.
